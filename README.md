# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Tech Train has arrived the station and we are excited to welcome you to the **Hands-on Azure Development** course! We hope that you will find this course informative and engaging. ☁️🚂
👨‍💻👩‍💻😊

This hands-on course is designed for developers and SREs who want to gain practical experience with various Azure, cloud services and production best practices. Over multiple in-person sessions, participants will explore essential tools, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Bicep, and Ev2 understanding. Additionally, participants will delve into real-world hero scenarios, covering essentials topics such as security, serverless, and event-driven solutions. By the end of the course, attendees will be equipped to apply their knowledge to create efficient, scalable, and secure solutions in the Azure ecosystem.

In this course you will solve a series of challenges that will help you gain hands-on experience, enhancing a complete ToDo application blueprint based on [azure-samples/todo-csharp-cosmos-sql](https://github.com/azure-samples/todo-csharp-cosmos-sql), that includes everything you need to build, deploy, and monitor an Azure solution.
